<div class="para">The main purpose of the Fluency Assessments is to ensure that you are able to accurately complete the tasks that are aligned with our targeted learning outcomes. In turn, this ensures that you are adequately prepared for further explorations both inside and outside of this course. Since it is important for us to ensure you are doing these tasks accurately, we have a high bar to earn fluency. However, we do not care if you earn fluency on your first attempt, or on a subsequent attempt; all that matters is that, by some combination of practice, review, and the incorporation of feedback, you can eventually demonstrate you are fluent in the objective.</div>
