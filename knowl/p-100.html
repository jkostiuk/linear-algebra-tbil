<div class="para">To assess teamwork, your team will provide both formative and summative feedback to each other throughout the term. Near the half-way mark of the semester, an anonymous form will be shared for your team to provide formative feedback to each other. The main purpose of this feedback is to help you and your team identify way to improve your processes and further cultivate a strong working group. The results of this survey do not affect oneâ€™s grade, but completion of the survey is worth 2.5% of your overall grade. At the end of the semester, teammates will score their teamwork using criteria co-created by our class; this will make up 5% of your overall grade.</div>
