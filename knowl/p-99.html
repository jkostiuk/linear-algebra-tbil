<div class="para">Critical reflection is an integral part of the deep learning process. It helps us digest and personalize what we learn which, in turn, makes our learnings more valuable. Roughly every other week, you’ll be asked to share your perspective on a variety of applications and topics in this course, as well as your thought processes. In doing so, we hope you’ll be better able to contextualize your learning and identify your growth as a problem solver and mathematician over the course of the term. In other words, these reflections will help you consolidate your learning gains over the term. Reflections are worth 7.5% of your overall grade.</div>
