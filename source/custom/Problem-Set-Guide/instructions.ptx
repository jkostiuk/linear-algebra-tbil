            <p>
                Like all forms of writing, it will take practice, and the incorporation of feedback, to feel confident in writing mathematics well. 
                While it may feel like it at the beginning, we want to stress that our goal is not to have you write the exact same way that we do. 
                Rather, we want you to be able to express yourself precisely, so that you may share your ideas and perspectives accurately with the greater community.
