        <title>What Kinds of Problems Will Appear on Problem Sets?</title>
        <p>
            Different types of problems assess different learning outcomes and promote the development of different skills and habits. 
            To help you better understand the kind of problems that you will encounter your problem set (and why you are encountering them), it is instructive to examine the basic types of problems that make up this TBIL course, as described in <url href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10511970.2019.1666440">Team-Based Inquiry Learning</url>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Broadly speaking, the problems that you encounter in this course (both inside and outside of the classroom) fall into the following types:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <em>Scaffolded Exploration</em> problems introduce you to a new concept through a sequence of carefully scaffolded activities. 
                        These activities include exploratory activities to motivate an entire line of thinking; working a series of examples to have students realize the need for a new definition; and working a carefully scaffolded problem to develop a general algorithm for solving similar problems, for example.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <em>Fluency Builders</em> are designed to help you develop fluency in a new concept. 
                        You will work on such problems both in-class with your teammates after learning a new concepts, but also outside of class while you study. 
                        All of the problems that you will see on Fluency Assessments are Fluency Builders.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <em>Flexible Extensions</em> are problems that require you to apply a concept in a new setting. 
                        These problems can take a variety of forms and include: checking if something satisfies a new definition; extending an idea from its <q>natural</q> setting to something more general; or, a true application to another field or topic.
                        In these activities, the emphasis is on developing a flexible mindset when faced with new problems.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            The most common types of problems that you will work on in class are Scaffolded Explorations and Fluency Builders. 
            In contrast, your Problem Sets will largely priortize Flexible Extensions.

        <remark>
            <p>
                Like all forms of writing, it will take practice, and the incorporation of feedback, to feel confident in writing mathematics well. 
                While it may feel like it at the beginning, we want to stress that our goal is not to have you write the exact same way that we do. 
                Rather, we want you to be able to express yourself precisely, so that you may share your ideas and perspectives accurately with the greater community.
