            <title>Linear Algebra</title>
            <p>
                Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics devoted to theory of linear equations and transformations.
                A solid understanding of linear algebra allows you to (among other things):
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            solve systems of linear equations;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            determine the geometry of the set of solutions to such a system;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            analyze the geometry and identify important properties of a linear transformation;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            use linear algebra tto model problems in a variety of disciplines. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul> 
                These skills will no doubt be used in your future mathematics and STEM courses and we'll feature a few such applications throughout the term. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Math 0520 is a first course in linear algebra that will focus on the development of the standard algorithms in the subject via student inquiry, as well as the underlying geometry. 
                Along the way, you will also develop your ability to understand proofs<mdash/>the logical arguments that form the foundation of mathematical reasoning<mdash/>and get the opportunity to write many of your own.

            <title>Am I Ready for Math 0520?</title>
            <p>
                Almost certainly!
                There are no prerequisities for Math 0520.
                Most students have usually taken one semester of college-level math (typically calculus), but this is not at all necessary and the contents will not draw upon previous knowledge. 
                This is a great option for a first-year college-level mathematics course. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If it has been a whhile since you've taken a college-level math course, you may find yourself needing more time to adjust than your classmates. 
                That is normal and we can talk about strategies to accelerate your adaption if this is a concern of yours. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to Math 0520, Brown also offers Math 0540: Linear Algebra with Theory. 
                Math 0540 is a higher-level introduction to linear algebra with a greater emphasis on the development of axiomatic principles and proof-writing skills.

            <title>Inclusive Teaching</title>
            <p>
                Large, introductory STEM courses are well-documented as playing an outsized role in dissuading members of historically excluded groups from pursuing STEM careers. 
                I recognize that, as an instructor of this large, introductory mathematics course, the course design decisions that I have made will affect your perceived ability and desire to concentrate in a STEM field. 
                My sincere hope is that you leave Math 0520 a more capable and resilient problem solver and that you feel supported in this journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                I acknowledge that not every student will have this idealized experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am committed to continuing my education about evidenced-based and equity-focussed approaches to teaching, and to learning from the hundreds of students I have the pleasure of teaching each semester. 
                If you have thoughts, questions, or concerns about this course, or STEM education at Brown, I welcome your perspective and encourage you to reach out to me.

                                Jordan's lessons are recorded on Zoom and uploaded to the Media Library on Canvas. 
                                These may be helpful to you if you miss class, or otherwise want to consult or remind yourself of the flow of a particular lesson.

            <p>
                Attendance in class sessions is recorded and contributes 7.5% towards your final grade; it is recorded by the teaching team in Canvas beginning after shopping period.
                Each student is provided <em>one week's worth of personal days</em> (3 sessions for MWF students; 2 sessions to TTh students) to use for absences of any kind. 
                Absences other than these personal days will not be excused, unless accompanied by a Dean's Note. 
                If you are ill or otherwise unable to attend class for a long period of time, please contact your instructor to come up with a plan to keep you on pace for the term. 
                Late attendances (defined as entering class sometime after the first activity of class has begun) are worth 50% of attendances.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our classroom is equipped with Zoom and I (Jordan) will record all of my class meetings. 
                The recordings will appear in the Media Library on Canvas shortly after class.

                Deadlines help me keep my workload balanced and keep you on track, ultimately resulting in a better learning experience for all of us. 
                Every assessment in this course has a deadline; some of them are hard deadlines, but there are others for which there is flexibility. 
                Here are the descriptions of the deadlines of our most common assessments:

            <title>Communication</title>
            <p>
                This course has two primary channels for communicating outside of class and office hours: <em>Ed STEM</em> and <em>e-mail</em>.
                If you have a question about an assignment, course, policy, concept, or anything else that might benefit the class as a whole, please post on Ed STEM; you're welcome to post anonymously if you are shy. 
                On the other hand, if you need to talk to us about something that is personal to your situation, please do send us an e-mail. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Everyone has different workflows and boundaries around email communication.
                Here are my expectations when it comes to email communication in this course; your instructor's expectations may differ from these, so take note when they share their own expectations.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I will work to respond to your message within 24 hours, or else on Monday if you write to me on Friday. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I will generally not respond or check email outside of 7:00am-4:30pm Eastern.
