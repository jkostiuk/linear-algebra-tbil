<div class="para">In this course, Problem Sets make up the most significant portion of assessment. Their main purpose is to assess your ability to make sense of new problems, apply concepts in new settings, and further develop your ability to communicate mathematical ideas to an audience of your peers and professionals alike. Problem Sets are significant assignments that we expect students to devote substantial time throughout the available two week period to complete them; they are not designed to be successfully completed within a single sitting.</div>
