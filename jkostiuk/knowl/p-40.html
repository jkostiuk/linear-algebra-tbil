<div class="para">Large, introductory STEM courses are well-documented as playing an outsized role in dissuading members of historically excluded groups from pursuing STEM careers. I recognize that, as an instructor of this large, introductory mathematics course, the course design decisions that I have made will affect your perceived ability and desire to concentrate in a STEM field. My sincere hope is that you leave Math 0520 a more capable and resilient problem solver and that you feel supported in this journey.</div>
