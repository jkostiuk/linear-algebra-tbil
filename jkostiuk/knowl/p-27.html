<div class="para">In addition to the high-level learning outcomes for the course described above, each section of our Activity Book corresponds to a single <em class="emphasis">targeted learning outcome</em>â€”a specific learning outcome that will be assessed throughout our Fluency Assessment protocol that is described below. These targeted learning outcomes are chosen to form a strong foundation for your continued exploration of the course material, with all further knowledge being built up, in some way, from these outcomes.</div>
