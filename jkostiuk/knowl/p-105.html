<div class="para">Attendance in class sessions is recorded and contributes 7.5% towards your final grade; it is recorded by the teaching team in Canvas beginning after shopping period. Each student is provided <em class="emphasis">one week’s worth of personal days</em> (3 sessions for MWF students; 2 sessions to TTh students) to use for absences of any kind. Absences other than these personal days will not be excused, unless accompanied by a Dean’s Note. If you are ill or otherwise unable to attend class for a long period of time, please contact your instructor to come up with a plan to keep you on pace for the term. Late attendances (defined as entering class sometime after the first activity of class has begun) are worth 50% of attendances.</div>
