<div class="para">Broadly speaking, the problems that you encounter in this course (both inside and outside of the classroom) fall into the following types:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Scaffolded Exploration</em> problems introduce you to a new concept through a sequence of carefully scaffolded activities. These activities include exploratory activities to motivate an entire line of thinking; working a series of examples to have students realize the need for a new definition; and working a carefully scaffolded problem to develop a general algorithm for solving similar problems, for example.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Fluency Builders</em> are designed to help you develop fluency in a new concept. You will work on such problems both in-class with your teammates after learning a new concepts, but also outside of class while you study. All of the problems that you will see on Fluency Assessments are Fluency Builders.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Flexible Extensions</em> are problems that require you to apply a concept in a new setting. These problems can take a variety of forms and include: checking if something satisfies a new definition; extending an idea from its “natural” setting to something more general; or, a true application to another field or topic. In these activities, the emphasis is on developing a flexible mindset when faced with new problems.</div></li>
